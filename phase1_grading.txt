There are some minor visual problems. For example, in the search page when 
the background changes, the text and the background sometimes doesn't create 
harmony.

Clicking on the user/admin picture will redirect to a strange webpage with
not working css. Also, the admin page buttons do not work. (-2.5)

The areas that require server call were not commented (-1.5)

For css and javascript I suggest that you create folders. Since currently
the project root looks a bit messy.
