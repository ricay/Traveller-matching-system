Late submit:
commit "fix profile" at 10:54pm is the late submit, which should be graded as late.
We fix the bug since profile and plan are the main functionalities and features of our app.

Friends on the way, is a website for travellers to find their ideal
fellow travellers.
This is our deployed URL: https://calm-cove-08678.herokuapp.com/

===========How to use(Roles and Features)=========================
Based on our proposal, we rearranged our functionality and features,
and there are too much code complexity in our project, so we delete the choice of
uploading a picture.

For normal user: This app's potential users are users who are passionate about
creating travel plans as well as wanting to find fellow travellers to go together.
All users have their own profile and own plans (User Profiling)
after log in(User Authentication). They can search a place for finding other user's plans,
select existing trip, choose to join the pool of users who want to take this trip, and connect users.

For admin: Our application only has one admin user in the data base.
Log in with email: admin, password: admin and you will go to the admin page.
(Authorization)
Admin can insert new recommendations, manage plans and delete existing users.

========Overview of the routes in Express server==================

Express routes are in server.js. The file is commented properly
so you can take a look at that. Basically we have several routes for
different purposes.
One route is for User, for example: app.post('/users/signup'),app.post('/users/login'),
app.put('/editProfile'), app.get('/logout'),
The other route is for get user, user's profile, and user's plan.
Another route is for admin, for example: app.post('/admin/insertRecommendation'),
app.delete('/admin/deleteUser/:userName').
